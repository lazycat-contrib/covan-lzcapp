-- Every client-written message must name the person who wrote it.
--
-- This replaces the collaborative-chat INSERT policy, whose `role = 'assistant'`
-- branch let any member of a shared session insert a message with no sender at
-- all. The check below requires sender_id = auth.uid() unconditionally, so a
-- client-written row always carries its author, and the unattributed rows the
-- worker writes for the assistant are ones no client can produce.
--
-- What it does not do is constrain `role` — which this file's first version
-- claimed it did. The policy below never inspects it, and there is no trigger
-- on messages and no revoke, so `authenticated` keeps its PostgREST INSERT: a
-- member could write role='assistant' carrying their own sender_id into any
-- session they could see, and the chat UI, which branches on role alone,
-- rendered it under the agent's name and avatar.
--
-- 0018_message_authorship.sql closes that by adding `and role = 'user'` to the
-- same check. Read the two together; this policy is superseded.
