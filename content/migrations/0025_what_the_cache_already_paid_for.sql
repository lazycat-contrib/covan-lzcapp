-- 0025_what_the_cache_already_paid_for.sql
--
-- `chat.ts` goes to real trouble to be cacheable. The persona, the document
-- manifest and the prior turns are assembled so the prefix is byte-identical
-- turn over turn, and the retrieved knowledge block is deliberately placed
-- *after* them — just before the latest user turn — so that the one part of the
-- prompt that changes every turn cannot invalidate the part that does not.
-- OpenAI's automatic prompt cache then serves the repeated prefix at a
-- discount: half price on the 4o models, a quarter on the 4.1 models.
--
-- None of which has ever been measured. `0006` recorded `prompt_tokens` and
-- `completion_tokens` and stopped there, so the usage view has always priced
-- every prompt token as fresh. Two things follow, and they point opposite ways:
-- the displayed cost is an overestimate, and — the reason this migration
-- exists — a change that quietly breaks the cache would show up as nothing at
-- all. The arrangement above is load-bearing and currently unobservable.
--
-- Input is roughly two thirds of the tokens and about half the bill, so the
-- discount is worth knowing the size of before anyone tunes the history or
-- retrieval budgets against it. Measured 2026-08-23 against the project
-- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` actually points at: 10 assistant replies averaging 2,248
-- prompt to 921 completion tokens, which on gpt-4o is about $0.015 a reply.
--
-- Ten replies is a small sample and the database was days old — rebuilt from
-- zero on 2026-08-22 — so treat the ratio as the finding and the absolute
-- figures as provisional.
--
-- One procedural note, because it cost a measurement: the first run of this was
-- taken against a retired predecessor project by mistake. A superseded Supabase
-- project stays reachable and healthy and answers exactly like the live one, so
-- nothing about the response tells you that you are querying history. Resolve
-- the ref from the environment you are actually deploying, never from memory.
--
-- Nullable with no default and no backfill: every reply already stored was
-- billed under an unknown cache state, and writing 0 would assert those prompts
-- missed the cache entirely. They may well not have. Null means "not recorded",
-- which is the truth, and `estimateCostUsd` reads a missing count as no
-- discount — so historical rows keep the figure they have always shown.
--
-- Reported by OpenAI as `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`, and it is
-- a SUBSET of `prompt_tokens`, not an addition. Anything summing the two would
-- double-count; `worker/src/lib/pricing.ts` subtracts it back out.

alter table public.messages add column if not exists cached_tokens int;

-- DROP first, unlike 0022 which replaced this function in place. `create or
-- replace function` cannot change a function's return type, and adding columns
-- to a `returns table` is exactly that — it fails with "cannot change return
-- type of existing function" and the migration stops half-applied. 0022 could
-- replace because its returned columns were identical; this one cannot.
--
-- Dropping means the grants go too. On this database they are explicit rather
-- than inherited (`anon`, `authenticated` and `service_role` each hold EXECUTE,
-- checked 2026-08-23), and a recreated function would come back with whatever
-- the platform default happens to be that day — the moving target 0023 was
-- written about. So they are re-granted below, in this file, rather than left
-- to be inherited. Without EXECUTE the symptom is the same unhelpful 42501 from
-- PostgREST that 0023 documents.

-- leaning on a select policy to do it (0022 explains at length why that
-- distinction matters), and still a LEFT JOIN with the message condition in the
-- ON clause so an agent nobody has chatted with keeps appearing at zero.
